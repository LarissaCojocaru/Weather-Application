Weather Application

The project includes a homepage with a background video, a title with a brief description, and a button. Additionally, there is a page called "Weather" where you can select any country or city and receive the city's data and weather information. For the city's data, you will receive the country, state, and region, while for the weather information, you will receive details about the current weather and temperature for the next 6 hours, as well as the temperature for the next 6 days. By clicking the "Save" button, you will save the city's data in local storage and be redirected to the "Favorite City" page, where you will find a table displaying the saved city's data and the map location of each saved city. There is also a header to navigate between pages. Regarding themes, there are two options: day and night (as more data is not provided by the weather API). The APIs used are from https://www.weatherapi.com and https://www.maptiler.com/.
